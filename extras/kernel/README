The kernel patches in this directory must be applied on kernel
versions < 3.8 in order to get UMIP working on such kernels. 
They have been tested on 3.7.1 and 3.7.2 kernels. They can be
applied in any order.

These patches have been merged upstream and do not need to be 
applied on kernel versions 3.8 and above.
